This project investigates which asset classes provide a reliable hedge against inflation for Swiss investors. Using historical data, we analyze the performance of equities, bonds, real estate, and commodities during periods of high inflation. Our findings suggest that specific asset classes provide superior protection and diversification benefits during inflationary periods, with their effectiveness varying based on the horizon of the hedge. The analysis and findings presented in this project are for informational and academic purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice or recommendations.
